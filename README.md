## Description

Users are able to search for a city and get both the current weather conditions as well as the five day forecast

### Usage
<img src="./">
Users are presented with an search bar on the left side of the page where they can type in a city name and click search or press enter to trigger the search functions. If the city is not in the Weather APi database, a pop up alert asks the user to try a different input.
On searching for a valid city name, the current weather conditions will appear in the top right section while the 5 day forecast appears in the bottom right section. The city name will also be added to the search history, appearing below the search bar. Selecting any of the previously searched city names will bring up the weather for the selected city again. Users are give the option to clear their search history at the bottom of the search history list and will also be cleared automatically on page load.
